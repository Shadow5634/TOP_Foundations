    <h2>Welcome to the Semantic HTML Page</h2>

    <!-- An article is an individual piece of element on your web page. It is meaningful if pulled out -->
    <!-- It has all the context required to be meaningful by itself and doesn't require other content from the web page -->
    <!-- As a result think of them as mini web pages that have their own headers, footers, and doc outline 
      that are completely isolated from the rest of your site. -->
    <article>
      <!-- Each article should have a heading inside it at the start for correct outline -->
      <h3>Anime article</h3>
      Anime is the best. Netflix and Prime Video shows are trash.
      You have classics such as One Piece and Inazuma Eleven
      And absolute masterpieces such as Monster and Attack on Titan
    </article>

    <!-- Sections are used to cover content relating to the same theme -->
    <!-- Unlike articles they may need surrounding content to make sense -->
    <!-- Headers may not be enough, Sections have their own layout feature like article and divisions -->
    <section>
      <!-- Each section should have a heading inside it at the start for correct outline -->
      <h3>Basketball Section</h3>
      This is a section. It covers different tactics relating to Basketball.
      Intro to the screeen: block enemy from guard
      Intro to the alley-oop: Easy version of the dunk<br><br>
    </section>

    <!-- Used to separate out content unlike headers and footers which add content -->
    <!-- Indirect relation to site content.  -->
    <!-- Ads, stats, def, quotes are typical usages -->

    <!-- Divisions is the common unsemantic version of the different elements we saw here -->
    <!-- Allows stlying to the entire division using CSS so can be used for entire web page formatting -->
    <div>Division here.<br><br></div>

    <!-- This by itself is not displayed on the webpage. Need words between starting and closing tags for that -->
